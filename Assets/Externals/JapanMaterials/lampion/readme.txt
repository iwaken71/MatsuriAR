INSTRUCTIONS:
Simply drag any of the lampion Prefabs located in the "prefabs" folder into your Scene. You can adjust their flickering behaviour by altering the "LightFlicker" script's sliders located on the Prefab. You can also overwrite the light's settings at runtime by accessing the public method "overrideSettings" of the "LightFlicker" script.

To turn the lights off entirely, simply uncheck the "Flickering" value on the "LightFlicker" script and set "Brightness" to 0.
